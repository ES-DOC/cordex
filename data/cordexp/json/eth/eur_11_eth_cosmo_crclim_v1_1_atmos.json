                "The Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) is a non-hydrostatic limited-area atmospheric model (Rockel et al. 2008, Baldauf et al. 2011, see http://www.cosmo-model.org/, https://www.clm-community.eu/). COSMO solves the fully compressible governing equations using finite difference methods on a structured grid. It employs a split-explicit third-order Runge-Kutta discretization in time and is discretized on a rotated latitude-longitude grid using terrain-following surfaces. For the representation of unresolved processes, the following physical parameterization schemes are used (Baldauf et al. 2011): a radiative transfer scheme, a single-moment bulk cloud-microphysics scheme with 5 species (cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and graupel), a multilayer soil model, a turbulence scheme using a turbulent-kinetic-energy closure, and a surface transfer scheme. Sub-grid convection is parameterized using an adapted version of the Tiedtke mass-flux scheme with a moisture convergence closure. COSMO-crCLIM is the GPU version of COSMO (Fuhrer et al. 2014, 2018) and is described by Leutwyler et al. (2017). COSMO-crCLIM's land surface scheme TERRA includes a soil hydrology scheme (Schlemmer et al. 2018). All COSMO CORDEX configurations are described in S\u00f8rland et al. (2021)."

                "Subgrid-Scale Turbulence is parametrised using a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy closure at level 2.5. The  scheme includes the transition of turbulence which contributes mainly to the fluxes (diffusive turbulence) to very small scale (dissipative) turbulence by the action of small scale roughness elements, and the handling of non-local vertical diffusion due to the boundary layer scale turbulence. A parameterization of the pressure transport term is introduced in the TKE-equation to account for TKE-production by subgrid thermal circulations. The whole scheme is formulated in conservative thermodynamic variables together with a statistical cloud scheme according to Sommeria and Deardorff (1977) in order to consider subgrid-scale condensation effects.\nThe parametrization of surface layer fluxes extends the TKE equation to the constant flux layer using the Mellor-Yamada closure and introduces an additional laminar layer just above the surface. This makes it possible to discriminate between the values of the model variables at the rigid surface (e.g. radiative surface temperatures) and values at the roughness height z0 (lower boundary of the turbulent atmosphere). The Charnock formula to estimate the surface fluxes over sea is also reformulated using TKE.\nMoist Convection is parametrised with the Tiedtke (1989) mass-flux convection scheme with equilibrium closure based on moisture convergence. The mass flux scheme of Tiedtke (1989) discriminates three types of moist convection: shallow convection, penetrative convection and midlevel convection, which are treated by different closure conditions. Both shallow and penetrative convection have their roots in the atmospheric boundary layer but they differ in vertical extent, while midlevel convection originates at levels within the free atmosphere. As a closure condition, the Tiedtke scheme requires a formulation of the vertical mass flux at the convective cloud base in terms of the grid-scale variables. For shallow and penetrative convection, it is assumed that this mass flux is proportional to the vertically integrated moisture convergence between the surface and the cloud base. In case of midlevel convection, the mass flux is set proportional to the grid-scale vertical velocity. Given the mass flux at cloud base, the vertical redistribution of heat, moisture and momentum as well as the formation of precipitation is then calculated by integrating a stationary cloud model for both updrafts and downdrafts. This allows to compute the convective tendencies, i.e. the feedback of the subgrid vertical circulation onto the resolved flow. The downdrafts are assumed to originate at the level of free sinking. As an additional closure condition, the downdraft mass flux in this level is set proportional to the updraft mass flux at cloud base. In subsaturated regions below cloud base, the precipitation in the downdrafts may evaporate with a parameterized rate. Depending on the temperature of the lowest model layer, the precipitation is interpreted as convective snow or rain. \nDetails can be found in http://www2.cosmo-model.org/content/model/documentation/core/cosmo_physics_5.05.pdf"
