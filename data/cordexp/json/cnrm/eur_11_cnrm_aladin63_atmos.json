                "CNRM-ALADIN63 is the version 6.3 of the ALADIN Regional Climate Model in use at CNRM (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France). It is described in Nabat et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8315-2020). The CNRM-ALADIN63 RCM includes an atmospheric component (also called CNRM-ALADIN63) RCM and the SURFEX platform (Decharme et al. 2019) to represent the land surfaces. The atmospheric component, CNRM-ALADIN63, is based on the cycle 37 of the ARPEGE/IFS model (declared in 2010), developed under a collaboration between M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, ECMWF and the ALADIN consortium. CNRM-ALADIN63 can be considered as the nearly perfect limited area version of the GCM ARPEGE-Climat Version 6.3 used as the atmospheric component of the CNRM Global Climate and Earth System models in CMIP6 (CNRM-CM6-1 and CNRM-ESM2-1) as it shares most of its physics and dynamics with it. In comparison to CNRM-ALADIN52 and CNRM-ALADIN53 used previously in CORDEX over different domains, most of the atmospheric physics has been updated or revisited (Roehrig et al. 2019, Voldoire et al. 2019, Nabat et al. 2020). The model has an hydrostatic dynamical core, an hybrid sigma-pressure vertical coordinate system and a Lambert conformal conic projection for the horizontal grid spacing. For the Euro-CORDEX configuration, CNRM-ALADIN63 uses 91 vertical levels and a 12.5km horizontal grid. More information: https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article125&lang=en "

Therefore no specific tuning has been done for the RCM: a significant part of the parameterization internal parameters, especially for the moist physics, were first guessed using single-column simulations of a few case studies (mostly shallow and deep convection).

The non-linear terms appearing in the right-hand side of the primitive equations are averaged along the trajectory using their interpolation at the trajectory mid- and departure points. The scheme uses 32-point quasi-cubic interpolations (linear interpolation along the edges of the stencil, fully cubic in the interior \u2013 see Ritchie et al., 1995). Interpolation are also quasi-monotone for all model advected variables (Bermejo & Staniforth, 1992), except the vertical interpolations involved in the momentum and thermodynamic equations. The semi-Lagrangian dynamical core is not fully conservative (e.g., Lucarini & Ragone, 2011). A regional and uniform conservation procedure (mass fixer) is applied for the model atmosphere dry mass (additive correction on the surface pressure): every day, the RCM atmosphere dry mass is forced to be the same as the GCM atmosphere dry mass over the central + relaxation zone.

The RRTM scheme follows the two-stream approach and computes upward and downward radiative fluxes in 16 spectral bands encompassing the 10-3000 cm-1 range. The parameterization uses the correlated-k approach with 140 g-points (the number per spectral band depends on the absorption coefficient variations within this band and on the spectral band contribution to the total flux). It includes line absorption by H2O, CO2 , O3 , CH4 , N2O, CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 based on the HITRAN 1996 spectrocospic data base (Rothman et al., 1998) and on the CKD 2.2 water vapor continuum model (Clough et al. 1989). The shortwave radiation scheme, originally developed by Fouquart and Bonnel (1980) and which further evolved in the IFS system until its cycle 32r2 (Morcrette et al., 2008), integrates the fluxes over the whole shortwave spectrum between 200 and 4000 nm. The scheme includes Rayleigh scattering, absorption by water vapor and ozone, both varying in space and time, and by CO2, N2O, CO, CH4 and O2, which are treated as uniformly mixed gases. The parameterization resolved the radiative transfer equations in 6 spectral bands, three bands being in the UV and visible spectral range (185-250, 250-440 and 440-690 nm) and three bands covering the near infrared range (690-1190, 1190-2380 and 2380-4000 nm)."

A prognostic treatment of the specific mass of four microphysical species (cloud liquid water, cloud ice, rain and snow) is adopted, with two main arguments for using prognostic equations to describe precipitating condensates: (i) given the relatively short time step of the model (15 min), it provides a finer description of the time evolution of the precipitation vertical distribution and associated processes (especially for snow) and (ii) it will allows a more direct approach for future data assimilation of precipitation data in the ARPEGE numerical weather prediction version, so that its use in climate application contributes to the seamless approach seeked at M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France (Bouteloup et al. 2011)."
